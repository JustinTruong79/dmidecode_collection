# dmidecode_collection

A collection of DMI decode data from various hardware and virtualization platforms

## Why?

Proper hypervisor detection on guests requires decoding DMI data. It's helpful to have a collection of known DMI datasets to use for testing and development purposes. Adding more hypervisors here helps us to improve virtualization detection in [Ohai](https://github.com/ohai)
